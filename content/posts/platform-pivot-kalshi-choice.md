# Platform Pivot: Why We're Using Kalshi Instead of Polymarket

**Plot twist:** We're switching platforms before we even start.

## The Geographic Reality Check

Turns out Polymarket blocks all US users—including those of us in Texas. The platform restricts 33+ countries, making it off-limits for our transparent, documented experiment.

**But this might be a blessing in disguise.**

## Enter Kalshi: The Compliant Choice

**Kalshi** is the CFTC-regulated prediction market built specifically for US users. Here's why the pivot actually improves our experiment:

### Legal Legitimacy
- **CFTC regulated** - Real regulatory oversight
- **Fully compliant** - No gray areas or geographic workarounds
- **Transparent operations** - Perfect for documented research

### Technical Capabilities  
- **REST API** for automated trading
- **WebSocket feeds** for real-time data
- **Programmatic access** to all markets
- **Comprehensive documentation**

### Market Diversity
- **Fed decisions** (Newton's macro analysis advantage)
- **Elections** (multi-source information synthesis)
- **Crypto markets** (real-time price prediction)
- **Weather events** (data-driven forecasting)
- **Economic indicators** (systematic analysis)

## What Changes (And What Doesn't)

**Staying the same:**
- $100 starting capital
- Automated AI trading
- Complete transparency
- Risk management framework
- Weekly progress reports

**Platform differences:**
- **Fees:** Kalshi charges ~3% vs Polymarket's ~1-2%
- **Liquidity:** Lower but sufficient for $100 experiment
- **Markets:** Different focus areas but still plenty of opportunities
- **Regulation:** Much clearer legal framework

## Why This Might Be Better

**1. Regulatory Clarity**
No questions about legality or compliance. Perfect for a documented experiment.

**2. Market Inefficiencies**
Smaller, newer platform means more potential pricing errors to exploit.

**3. Research Credibility**  
Using the "legitimate" US prediction market adds academic weight to findings.

**4. Content Differentiation**
Everyone talks about Polymarket. Kalshi analysis provides unique insights.

## Implementation Impact

The core trading system remains identical—just different API endpoints. The strategy framework, risk management, and performance tracking all transfer directly.

**Actually simpler setup:**
- No crypto wallet complexity
- No USDC conversion needed
- Standard USD deposits
- Familiar US financial regulations

## Moving Forward

Research is underway on Kalshi's specific:
- Market structure and liquidity patterns
- API rate limits and trading mechanics  
- Fee optimization strategies
- Available market categories for Newton's advantages

**The experiment timeline remains on track.** Platform pivot complete, technical implementation adapted, launch proceeding as planned.

Sometimes regulatory constraints force better choices. This might be one of those times.

**Next up:** Kalshi integration complete, first trades incoming. The data collection begins.

*Compliance > volume. Legitimacy > liquidity. Sometimes the regulated path is the right path.*
